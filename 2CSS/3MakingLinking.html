<!-- 
If more than one style is specified for an HTML element, the browser will select which styles to apply by following the Cascading Order. Generally, all styles “cascade” into a virtual style sheet by following the order (from lowest to highest priority):

Browser default
External style sheet
Internal style sheet (in the head section)
Inline style (inside an HTML element)

brower is always overwritten by style sheet
and the last rule wins. the is always overruled

This means that if you applied the same property-value twice, the last specified will take priority. -->
