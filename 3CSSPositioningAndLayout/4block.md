# BLOCK
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available in the container . The following are the block-level elements:

**THESE CREATE A WHOLE LINE THINGO, IT DEDICATES A CHUNK TO THE SIDE**
<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>
<li>

# INLINE
**THESE DO NOT START IN A THING, ITS NOT A CHUNK**
Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>

# FLEX



# NONE
used to hide and show elements without deleting them

Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none and visibility property as hidden. However, the difference is the hidden property will only hide the element and will use the same space for the element as before.



you can overide the elements' normal type 

p {
	display: inline;
}
