the page does a great thing of explaining

essentially, every html element has layers to it

the innermost being content, then padding, border, margin 

margin is the being on the very outside of the box, the whitespace/transparent for other elements. outside the porder

the border is the visible portion?

padding is the whitespace on the outside. the thing? "protecting the actual contents of the inside of the box"

content: the actual context of the html file

**note there is a difference between content width and total element width**

**total element width = left border + left padding + content width + right padding + right border**
