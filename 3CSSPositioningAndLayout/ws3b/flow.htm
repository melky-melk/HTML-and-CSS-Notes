			Information technologies (IT) and systems have emerged as the primary
			 platform to support communication, collaboration, research, decision
			  making, and problem solving in contemporary organisations. The essential
			 necessity for all university students to acquire the fundamental 
			 knowledge and skills for applying IT effectively for a wide range of 
			 tasks is widely recognised. It is an introductory unit of study which 
			 prepares students from any academic discipline to develop the 
			 necessary knowledge, skills and abilities to be competent in the use 
			 of information technology for solving a variety of problems. The 
			 main focus of this unit is on modelling and problem solving through 
			 the effective use of using IT. Students will learn how to navigate 
			 independently to solve their problems on their own, and to be capable 
			 of fully applying the power of IT tools in the service of their goals 
			 in their own domains while not losing sight of the fundamental 
			 concepts of computing.

			Students are taught core skills related to general purpose computing
			 involving a range of software tools such as spreadsheets, database 
			 management systems, internet search engine, HTML, and JavaScript. 
			 Students will undertake practical tasks including authoring an 
			 interactive website using HTML, JavaScript and AJAX and building a 
			 small scale application for managing information. In addition, the 
			 course will address the many social, ethical, and intellectual 
			 property issues arising from the wide-spread use of information 
			 technology in our society.
